# MERN Modules — Basic to Advanced

A modular, educational MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) project collection covering both basic and advanced topics. This repository contains hands-on modules, examples, and patterns to help developers build real-world full-stack applications, from authentication and CRUD to testing, deployment, and performance optimization.

## Project Overview

This repository is organized as a set of focused modules that teach and demonstrate practical MERN patterns. Each module is intended to be self-contained so you can clone, run, and explore independently or combine modules to build larger projects.

Use cases include: learning modern authentication flows (JWT, OAuth), implementing RESTful APIs, building production-ready React frontends, and deploying MERN apps to popular cloud providers.

## Features

- Clear, modular examples from beginner to advanced level
- Authentication and authorization (JWT, role-based access)
- CRUD operations with validation and sanitization
- File uploads and media handling (multer / Cloudinary examples)
- Pagination, filtering, and search for APIs
- Unit and integration tests for backend and frontend
- Environment-based configuration for development and production
- Example CI/CD workflow and Docker setup (where applicable)

## Tech Stack

- Node.js & Express — Backend API
- MongoDB / Mongoose — Database and ODM
- React (Create React App / Vite) — Frontend
- JWT, bcrypt — Authentication and security
- Multer / Cloudinary — File uploads
- Jest / Supertest — Testing backend
- ESLint / Prettier — Code quality and formatting

## Included Modules (Examples)

Note: Update the list below to reflect the actual modules in your repo. Typical modules in this collection are:

- 01-basic-setup — Starter MERN app with minimal configuration
- 02-authentication — User registration, login, JWT handling, password hashing
- 03-rest-crud — RESTful endpoints and CRUD operations with validation
- 04-file-upload — Image/file upload examples (multer + Cloudinary)
- 05-pagination-search — Pagination, filtering and search on list endpoints
- 06-testing — Unit and integration test examples
- 07-deployment — Dockerfile and deployment scripts for production

Please rename or remove entries to match the repository structure.

## Folder Structure

A recommended folder layout (may vary per module):

- /server — Express backend (routes, controllers, models, middleware)
- /client — React frontend
- /config — Environment configuration and constants
- /scripts — Helper scripts and tooling
- /tests — Test suites and helpers

## Getting Started

These instructions will get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+ recommended)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB instance (local or cloud e.g., MongoDB Atlas)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/sanjaysingh24/MERN-MODULES-Basic-advance-.git
   cd MERN-MODULES-Basic-advance-

2. Install server dependencies (if moduleized, run inside each module folder):

   cd server
   npm install

3. Install client dependencies (if present):

   cd ../client
   npm install

### Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the server (and client, if required) with variables similar to:

- PORT=5000
- MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
- JWT_SECRET=strong_jwt_secret
- JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1d
- CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
- CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
- CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=

Adjust names to match the codebase. Do not commit secrets to version control.

### Run Locally

From the project root or the specific module folder:

- Start backend (development):
  NODE_ENV=development nodemon server/index.js

- Start frontend (development):
  cd client
  npm start

- Full stack concurrently (example using concurrently package):
  npm run dev

## Available Scripts

Common npm scripts you might find or add:

- npm start — Start the production server
- npm run dev — Start server and client in development with hot reload
- npm test — Run tests
- npm run lint — Run ESLint
- npm run build — Build frontend for production

## API Examples

Example authentication endpoints (adjust to actual routes):

- POST /api/auth/register — Register a new user
- POST /api/auth/login — Login and receive JWT
- GET /api/users/me — Get current user (protected)

Example CRUD endpoints:

- GET /api/items — List items (with pagination & filtering)
- POST /api/items — Create an item (protected)
- GET /api/items/:id — Get item by id
- PUT /api/items/:id — Update item
- DELETE /api/items/:id — Delete item
